Package Name:   dotfiles
Public Repo:    https://github.com/bingotree/dotfiles
Author:         Brian Duncan
Summary:        Maintains a versioned collection of configuration files a la Michael Smalley's technique:
                http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/

Description:

    This project includes configuration files and the script 'create_dotfiles.sh' that takes a list of 
    system configuration files or "dotfiles" (eg .bashrc, .vimrc) and generates a symlink to them 
    in the users home directory. This allows environment variables and config files to be versioned 
    without needing to make the home directory a git repository. For system-specific or private
    configuration, the '_system' prefix may be used. '_system' files will be ignored by git, but still
    used by the script.

---- 

Usage

Source or execute this script:  ./create_dotfiles.sh
This list of files to generate may be configured in the script itself, by editing the $files variable.

2/17/2015 Updated bash configuration to use a directory, .bashrc.d/

# Now aliases, functions, etc are saved as
.bashrc.d/aliases.bash
.bashrc.d/functions.bash

# Anything with this format is sourced:
.bashrc.d/*.bash

I also added a .gitignore file with the following condition.
files beginning with '_system' will be ignored.
This way system-specific config may be set up using the same directory.
