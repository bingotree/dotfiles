Description: Maintain a versioned collection of configuration files a la Michael Smalley's technique:
http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/

---- 

2/17/2015 Updated bash configuration to use a directory, .bashrc.d/

# Now aliases, functions, etc are saved as
.bashrc.d/aliases.bash
.bashrc.d/functions.bash

# Anything with this format is sourced:
.bashrc.d/*.bash

I also added a .gitignore file with the following condition.
files beginning with '_system' will be ignored.
This way system-specific config may be set up using the same directory.
